How are graceful degradation and service workers related?\\
Graceful degredation and service workers are related in that graceful degredation describes the act of starting with a comlpex problem and making it 
into only what is necessary over time. With a network request, the most 'complex' way to do it would be to repeatedly make the request, but a service
worker will store the recieved data the first time gracefully degrading the problem into a much simpler and more efficient solution.
